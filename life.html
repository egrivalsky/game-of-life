        <p>The game of live as described by John Conway in 1970 can be summarized by three rules:
            <blockquote>
                <ol>
                    <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.</li>
                    <li>Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</li>
                    <li>All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.</li>
            </blockquote>
        The black cells are 'alive.'
        This board is not infinite and there for not a perfect GoL board, but it's fun to play with and it was fun to make.
